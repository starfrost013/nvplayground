NVPlay 0.5.0.0 is now available.

Changes:
* Added a "repl" loop that is the new default mode. Run "-test" to run tests. 
* Commands now store number of parameters and check for them
* Simplified terrible script parsing code
* Renamed nvplayground.h to nvplay.h
* More consistent function naming scheme
* Added log_settings.redirect to optionally redirect any of stdin, stdout and stderr to the log
* Implemented "generic" tests that are available across every GPU
* -t added as an alias for -test
* Added -boot / -bootonly command line option to initialise GPU and exit
* Added "RunTest" command to run a test
* Added "PrintVersion" command
* Added GPU_IsNVx functions for GPU-specific behaviour in generic tests

Old release notes:

0.4.0.0-rcX Changes:
* Implemented a new ".NVS" savestate format
	* Load a .NVS file using the -savestate / -nvs command line option. This will load a savestate into the graphics hardware!
	* Currently only full support on NV3, very experimental
	* File sections can be shared between every single GPU or per-GPU. Currently only NV3 per function sections are implemented
* A very basic command engine
	* Load a .NVP file using the -s / -script command line option
	* Various test scripts are provided
* Riva 128 (NV3):
	* AGP defines added
	* Removed nv3_api.h, merged it with nv3.h
* Riva TNT (NV4) support
	* Currently: NV4_DumpVBIOS, NV4_DumpMMIO, NV4_PrintMfgInfo tests
	* Tested working on 16MB STB Velocity 4400 (VBIOS Version 1.01, 24 August 1998)
* Added VGA attribute, sequencer and graphics register functions
* Added a help message (use -?)
* Fixed RAMIN reading for non-NV3 cards
* NVxPrintMfgInfo tests now print clockspeed in MHz for NV3/NV4
