NVPlay 1.0.0-rc4 is now available.

Changes:
	* Strip symbols in release mode builds
	* Fix -bootonly
	* Remove unfinished replay feature

NVPlay 1.0.0-rc3 is now available.

Changes:
	* Some text fixes 

NVPlay 1.0.0-rc2 is now available.

Changes:
	* Fixed test mode. 
	* Much shorter and less verbose help text with colours.

NVPlay 1.0.0-rc1 is now available.

Changes:
* Changed version number system (since version 0.x will go on forever otherwise)
* Added a "repl" loop that is the new default mode. Run "-test" to run tests. 
	* "?" or "help" at the REPL loop prints help.
	* "q" or "exit" exits.
* Riva 128 (NV3):
	* AGP defines added
	* Removed nv3_api.h, merged it with nv3.h
* Riva TNT (NV4) support
	* Currently: NV4_DumpVBIOS, NV4_DumpMMIO, NV4_PrintMfgInfo tests
	* Tested working on 16MB STB Velocity 4400 (VBIOS Version 1.01, 24 August 1998)
* Added support for TNT2 (NV5) and Celsius (NV1x) GPUs (untested!)
* Added HAL system
	* GPUs now store pointers to arrays of function pointers (not C++ yet...) to avoid GPU list having huge numbers of function pointers and to make calling GPU specific functions
	more elegant
* Implemented "generic" tests that are available across every GPU (for some of them, Hal functions are required )
* Commands now store number of parameters and check for them
* Simplified terrible script parsing code
* Simplified terrible config parsing code
* Massively simplify nv_config_test_entry_t (why was I duplicating half of the test information?)
* Added many new commands:
	* Read to console and write PCI config registers 
	* Write CRTC range
	* Read to console and write VGA Sequencer registers
	* Read to console and write VGA GDC registers
	* PrintVersion command
	* Run a test (RunTest)
* Renamed nvplayground.h to nvplay.h
* More consistent function naming scheme
* Added log_settings.redirect to optionally redirect any of stdin, stdout and stderr to the log
* -t added as an alias for -test
* Added -boot /  command line option to initialise GPU and exit
* Added GPU_IsNVx functions for GPU-specific behaviour in generic tests
* Added DumpRAMHT, DumpRAMFC and DumpRAMRO to dump RAMHT, RAMFC, and RAMRO
	* Currently NV3 only
* Added GPU_NV_GetGeneration functions to return a number equivalent to the NV codename for a chip
* Allowed dumping amounts of vram that are not 16 MB 
* Implemented a  very basic command engine
	* Load a .NVP file using the -s / -script command line option
	* Various test scripts are provided
* Added VGA attribute, sequencer and graphics register functions
* Added a help message (use -?)
* Fixed RAMIN reading for non-NV3 cards
* NVxPrintMfgInfo tests now print clockspeed in MHz for NV3/NV4 
* Removed never-used "main function mode"
