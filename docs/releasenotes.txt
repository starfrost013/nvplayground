NVPlay 2.0.0 is now available.

Release notes:
	* Large refactor of main.c. define exit codes, always call nvplay_shutdown
	* Implemented Windows detection code. It can detect Windows NT, 3.x and 9x. NT is blocked
	* Removed the never used gdbstub 
	* Split nvplay.h into header files for each category of functionality.
			* Merged tests.h and config.h into nvplay.h
	* Implemented BIOS basic "extended" keyboard input library
	* More consistent file naming 
	* Merged command line into core code. Added nvplay_state_t
		* Changed to state enum instead of booleans for run mode
	* Made enum casing UPPER CASE as recommended for C language
	* A script called "autoexec.nvs" is now run automatically if it exists.
	* Scripts can call other scripts with the runscript command 
	* Removed legacy test mode 
		* nvplay.ini no longer stores tests to run in test mode.
		* Dry run and run all tests removed
	* Fix CRTC unlock on NV4+: CRTC unlock was moved from SR[6] to CR[1F] in NV4. Not used on NV1
	* Use VGA port I/O to write to CRTC, GDC and SR registers
		* Fixes MMIO CRTC mirroring not existing on NV4 (only SR is mirrored)
	* Add attribute register commands and rename GDC to more common "GR" (Graphics Register)
	* Added errors when RAMHT, RAMRO, RAMFC and PGRAPH_CACHE failed to dump
	* Implemented PDCurses integration (Ported to CMake!)
	* Implement commands for x86 I/O ports: ioread8, ioread16, ioread32, iowrite8, iowrite16, iowrite32

Old release notes:
NVPlay 1.0.0 is now available.

Changes:
	* Strip symbols in release mode builds
	* Fix -bootonly
	* Remove unfinished replay feature
	* Fix sequence register locking 
	* Don't log tests twice
	* fix logging name of script file when script file cannot be opened

NVPlay 1.0.0-rc3 is now available.

Changes:
	* Some text fixes 

NVPlay 1.0.0-rc2 is now available.

Changes:
	* Fixed test mode. 
	* Much shorter and less verbose help text with colours.

NVPlay 1.0.0-rc1 is now available.

Changes:
* Changed version number system (since version 0.x will go on forever otherwise)
* Added a "repl" loop that is the new default mode. Run "-test" to run tests. 
	* "?" or "help" at the REPL loop prints help.
	* "q" or "exit" exits.
* Riva 128 (NV3):
	* AGP defines added
	* Removed nv3_api.h, merged it with nv3.h
* Riva TNT (NV4) support
	* Currently: NV4_DumpVBIOS, NV4_DumpMMIO, NV4_PrintMfgInfo tests
	* Tested working on 16MB STB Velocity 4400 (VBIOS Version 1.01, 24 August 1998)
* Added support for TNT2 (NV5) and Celsius (NV1x) GPUs (untested!)
* Added HAL system
	* GPUs now store pointers to arrays of function pointers (not C++ yet...) to avoid GPU list having huge numbers of function pointers and to make calling GPU specific functions
	more elegant
* Implemented "generic" tests that are available across every GPU (for some of them, Hal functions are required )
* Commands now store number of parameters and check for them
* Simplified terrible script parsing code
* Simplified terrible config parsing code
* Massively simplify nv_config_test_entry_t (why was I duplicating half of the test information?)
* Added many new commands:
	* Read to console and write PCI config registers 
	* Write CRTC range
	* Read to console and write VGA Sequencer registers
	* Read to console and write VGA GDC registers
	* PrintVersion command
	* Run a test (RunTest)
* Renamed nvplayground.h to nvplay.h
* More consistent function naming scheme
* Added log_settings.redirect to optionally redirect any of stdin, stdout and stderr to the log
* -t added as an alias for -test
* Added -boot /  command line option to initialise GPU and exit
* Added GPU_IsNVx functions for GPU-specific behaviour in generic tests
* Added DumpRAMHT, DumpRAMFC and DumpRAMRO to dump RAMHT, RAMFC, and RAMRO
	* Currently NV3 only
* Added GPU_NV_GetGeneration functions to return a number equivalent to the NV codename for a chip
* Allowed dumping amounts of vram that are not 16 MB 
* Implemented a  very basic command engine
	* Load a .NVP file using the -s / -script command line option
	* Various test scripts are provided
* Added VGA attribute, sequencer and graphics register functions
* Added a help message (use -?)
* Fixed RAMIN reading for non-NV3 cards
* NVxPrintMfgInfo tests now print clockspeed in MHz for NV3/NV4 
* Removed never-used "main function mode"


Old release notes:

0.4.0.0-rcX Changes:
* Implemented a new ".NVS" savestate format
	* Load a .NVS file using the -savestate / -nvs command line option. This will load a savestate into the graphics hardware!
	* Currently only full support on NV3, very experimental
	* File sections can be shared between every single GPU or per-GPU. Currently only NV3 per function sections are implemented
* A very basic command engine
	* Load a .NVP file using the -s / -script command line option
	* Various test scripts are provided
* Riva 128 (NV3):
	* AGP defines added
